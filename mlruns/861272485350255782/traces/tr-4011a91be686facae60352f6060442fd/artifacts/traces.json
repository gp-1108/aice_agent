Deliverables:\\n- Unit tests: cover model validation, password hashing/re-hash logic, token generation/validation, and edge-case handling. Achieve target unit test coverage for auth modules.\\n- Integration tests: end-to-end tests for registration, email verification, login/logout, token refresh, password reset, lockout behavior, and OAuth flows (using mocks or staging provider). Include CI jobs to run these tests automatically.\\n- Security tests: automated checks for common auth issues (JWT misconfiguration, weak crypto parameters), static analysis (SAST), dependency vulnerability scans, and dynamic scans (DAST) of auth endpoints. Include tests for CSRF, XSS, and session fixation scenarios.\\n- Penetration / security review: perform an internal security review or external pentest scope for the auth feature; document findings and remediation plans. Review key management, token lifecycle, and secrets handling.\\n- Test data and fixtures: provide reproducible test fixtures, mocked SMTP endpoints, and test accounts for QA and staging.\\n- API documentation: finalize OpenAPI/Swagger docs for all auth endpoints, include example requests/responses, error codes, and role-based access notes. Provide developer guidance for integrating clients (web/mobile).\\n- Deployment & runbook notes: document deployment steps, required environment variables, feature flags, migration steps, key rotation procedures, rollback plan, and post-deploy verification checklist (smoke tests, monitoring checks).\\n- Acceptance criteria: CI runs tests and passes, security review closed high-severity issues, documentation published in the repo/wiki, and runbook is present and validated in staging deploy.\\n\\n\\nFor EACH task, provide:\\n\\n1.

Deliverables: 1) A prioritized requirements document (metrics to display, widget types, interactions such as filters and drill-downs, access/role requirements, SLAs for data freshness and performance); 2) Clickable wireframes or high-fidelity mockups for desktop/tablet/phone breakpoints that show layout, responsive behavior, and interaction states; 3) UX interaction spec covering filter behavior, drill-down flows, empty/error states, keyboard/accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA baseline), and localization considerations; 4) Acceptance criteria and success metrics (KPIs, performance targets, allowed load times); 5) A data contract inventory listing data elements required by each widget (fields, types, cardinality, approximate volumes, update frequency). Required outputs should be review-ready (annotated designs + spec) and approved by product and at least one domain SME.\\n- Design data integration and backend APIs for widget aggregation and shaping: Produce the backend architecture and API design required to supply the dashboard. Deliverables: 1) System architecture diagram showing data sources, ingestion paths, transformation/aggregation components, storage choices (OLAP, timeseries, caching layers), and dataflow; 2) API specification (REST/GraphQL) for each widget and for aggregated views: endpoint paths, parameters (filters, pagination, time ranges), response schemas, error models, rate limits, and example requests/responses; 3) Data shaping and aggregation design: query patterns, pre-aggregation strategies, indexes, and any scheduled batch jobs or streaming transforms required; 4) Data model and contract definitions (field-level schema, types, nullability); 5) Performance targets and scaling plan (expected QPS, latency SLOs, caching TTLs); 6) Security considerations for data access and PII handling. Include mock sample payloads and an integration checklist for backend engineers.\\n- Implement authentication and authorization for dashboard access (SSO/OAuth/roles, session handling): Implement secure access controls for the dashboard consistent with organizational identity policies. Deliverables: 1) Integrate SSO/OAuth provider(s) (e.g., OIDC, SAML where applicable) and implement token handling (access/refresh tokens), session lifetime, and secure storage on client and server; 2) Role-based access control (RBAC) design and implementation: define roles/permissions mapping from requirements, enforce authorization checks at API and UI levels, and provide admin APIs to manage role assignments; 3) Session management and logout flows, token revocation, and multi-device considerations; 4) Secure default configs (HTTPS enforcement, secure cookies, CSRF protections, XSS mitigations for dashboard endpoints); 5) Automated tests for auth flows (happy path and failure modes) and documentation for identity setup. Provide runbook for onboarding new identity providers and a checklist to validate claims/role mappings.\\n- Develop frontend dashboard layout and responsive widgets (charts, filters, drill-downs): Implement the client-side dashboard UI according to the approved UX/spec. Deliverables: 1) Responsive layout implementation for desktop/tablet/phone with defined breakpoints and a reusable grid system; 2) Implement widget components: charts (line, bar, pie, heatmap), tables, KPI tiles, filters, and drill-down modal/route flows. Each widget should accept configuration props and conform to the data contract from backend APIs; 3) State management and client-side caching strategy for filters, user preferences, and persisted layouts; 4) Accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, color contrast) and internationalization hooks; 5) Integration with authentication to enforce UI-level access (hide/disable widgets based on roles) and handle token refresh; 6) Component-level unit tests, visual regression snapshots, and storybook entries or equivalent for each widget; 7) Performance optimizations: lazy loading of widgets, virtualization for long lists, and client-side debounce/throttle for filter inputs. Provide acceptance criteria and demo-ready build.\\n- Implement data refresh, caching and optional real-time updates (polling/websockets): Implement data freshness and scaling strategies to meet the dashboard SLA. Deliverables: 1) Caching layer design and implementation (server-side caches, CDN where applicable, client-side cache strategies) with TTLs, cache invalidation rules, and cache-busting strategies for deployments; 2) Data refresh policies per widget (manual refresh, background polling intervals, conditional refresh based on visibility) with configurable defaults; 3) Optional real-time update implementation for widgets that require live data: choose and implement approach (WebSocket/WS over TLS, Server-Sent Events, or pub/sub streaming), define message schemas, reconnection/backoff strategies and server scaling plan; 4) Backpressure and rate-limiting strategy to protect origin services; 5) Integration tests that validate refresh behavior and correctness under update scenarios; 6) Monitoring and metrics for cache hit rate, staleness, real-time message throughput, and errors. Provide a fallback plan for environments that block websockets (polling mode) and documentation for config tuning.\\n- Testing & QA: unit, integration, E2E, performance and security tests, and QA checklist: Create and execute a comprehensive testing plan covering all layers of the Dashboard. Deliverables: 1) Unit tests for frontend components and backend services with target coverage thresholds (e.g., >80% for critical modules); 2) Integration tests for API contracts, auth flows, and end-to-end data paths (mocking upstream data sources where required); 3) E2E test suites that validate critical user journeys (login, access control, filtering, drill-down, export) across supported browsers/devices; 4) Performance/load tests with defined scenarios and targets (concurrent users, requests per second, response time SLOs) and a report identifying bottlenecks; 5) Security testing checklist and automated scans (dependency vulnerability scans, OWASP ZAP or equivalent, pen-test recommendations for sensitive flows); 6) Regression test plan and CI integration to run relevant tests on PRs; 7) Final QA checklist and acceptance sign-off criteria for product and security teams. Provide test artifacts, failure triage guides, and a prioritized defects list.\\n- Deployment, CI/CD, environment configuration, security hardening and user/operations documentation: Prepare the Dashboard for production release and operational support. Deliverables: 1) CI/CD pipelines that run linting, unit/integration tests, build artifacts, run E2E smoke tests, and deploy to target environments (staging, canary, production) with rollback strategies; 2) Infrastructure-as-Code templates (Terraform/CloudFormation) or manifests (Kubernetes Helm/Manifests) for all required environments and resources (compute, caches, message brokers, load balancers); 3) Environment configuration and secrets management plan (secure vault integration, environment variable conventions, staging/production differences); 4) Security hardening checklist (network policies, TLS enforcement, CSP headers, least-privilege IAM roles, logging and audit retention); 5) Observability setup: logs, structured traces, metrics dashboards, alerting rules for SLO breaches and operational incidents; 6) Runbooks and on-call playbooks for common incidents (auth failures, data pipeline outages, real-time disconnects); 7) User documentation and admin guides covering feature usage, role management, troubleshooting steps, and upgrade notes. Validate deployment in staging and document a production rollout plan with smoke test gates.\\n\\nFor EACH task, provide:\\n\\n1.

Deliverables: 1) A prioritized requirements document (metrics to display, widget types, interactions such as filters and drill-downs, access/role requirements, SLAs for data freshness and performance); 2) Clickable wireframes or high-fidelity mockups for desktop/tablet/phone breakpoints that show layout, responsive behavior, and interaction states; 3) UX interaction spec covering filter behavior, drill-down flows, empty/error states, keyboard/accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA baseline), and localization considerations; 4) Acceptance criteria and success metrics (KPIs, performance targets, allowed load times); 5) A data contract inventory listing data elements required by each widget (fields, types, cardinality, approximate volumes, update frequency). Required outputs should be review-ready (annotated designs + spec) and approved by product and at least one domain SME.\\n- Design data integration and backend APIs for widget aggregation and shaping: Produce the backend architecture and API design required to supply the dashboard. Deliverables: 1) System architecture diagram showing data sources, ingestion paths, transformation/aggregation components, storage choices (OLAP, timeseries, caching layers), and dataflow; 2) API specification (REST/GraphQL) for each widget and for aggregated views: endpoint paths, parameters (filters, pagination, time ranges), response schemas, error models, rate limits, and example requests/responses; 3) Data shaping and aggregation design: query patterns, pre-aggregation strategies, indexes, and any scheduled batch jobs or streaming transforms required; 4) Data model and contract definitions (field-level schema, types, nullability); 5) Performance targets and scaling plan (expected QPS, latency SLOs, caching TTLs); 6) Security considerations for data access and PII handling. Include mock sample payloads and an integration checklist for backend engineers.\\n- Implement authentication and authorization for dashboard access (SSO/OAuth/roles, session handling): Implement secure access controls for the dashboard consistent with organizational identity policies. Deliverables: 1) Integrate SSO/OAuth provider(s) (e.g., OIDC, SAML where applicable) and implement token handling (access/refresh tokens), session lifetime, and secure storage on client and server; 2) Role-based access control (RBAC) design and implementation: define roles/permissions mapping from requirements, enforce authorization checks at API and UI levels, and provide admin APIs to manage role assignments; 3) Session management and logout flows, token revocation, and multi-device considerations; 4) Secure default configs (HTTPS enforcement, secure cookies, CSRF protections, XSS mitigations for dashboard endpoints); 5) Automated tests for auth flows (happy path and failure modes) and documentation for identity setup. Provide runbook for onboarding new identity providers and a checklist to validate claims/role mappings.\\n- Develop frontend dashboard layout and responsive widgets (charts, filters, drill-downs): Implement the client-side dashboard UI according to the approved UX/spec. Deliverables: 1) Responsive layout implementation for desktop/tablet/phone with defined breakpoints and a reusable grid system; 2) Implement widget components: charts (line, bar, pie, heatmap), tables, KPI tiles, filters, and drill-down modal/route flows. Each widget should accept configuration props and conform to the data contract from backend APIs; 3) State management and client-side caching strategy for filters, user preferences, and persisted layouts; 4) Accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, color contrast) and internationalization hooks; 5) Integration with authentication to enforce UI-level access (hide/disable widgets based on roles) and handle token refresh; 6) Component-level unit tests, visual regression snapshots, and storybook entries or equivalent for each widget; 7) Performance optimizations: lazy loading of widgets, virtualization for long lists, and client-side debounce/throttle for filter inputs. Provide acceptance criteria and demo-ready build.\\n- Implement data refresh, caching and optional real-time updates (polling/websockets): Implement data freshness and scaling strategies to meet the dashboard SLA. Deliverables: 1) Caching layer design and implementation (server-side caches, CDN where applicable, client-side cache strategies) with TTLs, cache invalidation rules, and cache-busting strategies for deployments; 2) Data refresh policies per widget (manual refresh, background polling intervals, conditional refresh based on visibility) with configurable defaults; 3) Optional real-time update implementation for widgets that require live data: choose and implement approach (WebSocket/WS over TLS, Server-Sent Events, or pub/sub streaming), define message schemas, reconnection/backoff strategies and server scaling plan; 4) Backpressure and rate-limiting strategy to protect origin services; 5) Integration tests that validate refresh behavior and correctness under update scenarios; 6) Monitoring and metrics for cache hit rate, staleness, real-time message throughput, and errors. Provide a fallback plan for environments that block websockets (polling mode) and documentation for config tuning.\\n- Testing & QA: unit, integration, E2E, performance and security tests, and QA checklist: Create and execute a comprehensive testing plan covering all layers of the Dashboard. Deliverables: 1) Unit tests for frontend components and backend services with target coverage thresholds (e.g., >80% for critical modules); 2) Integration tests for API contracts, auth flows, and end-to-end data paths (mocking upstream data sources where required); 3) E2E test suites that validate critical user journeys (login, access control, filtering, drill-down, export) across supported browsers/devices; 4) Performance/load tests with defined scenarios and targets (concurrent users, requests per second, response time SLOs) and a report identifying bottlenecks; 5) Security testing checklist and automated scans (dependency vulnerability scans, OWASP ZAP or equivalent, pen-test recommendations for sensitive flows); 6) Regression test plan and CI integration to run relevant tests on PRs; 7) Final QA checklist and acceptance sign-off criteria for product and security teams. Provide test artifacts, failure triage guides, and a prioritized defects list.\\n- Deployment, CI/CD, environment configuration, security hardening and user/operations documentation: Prepare the Dashboard for production release and operational support. Deliverables: 1) CI/CD pipelines that run linting, unit/integration tests, build artifacts, run E2E smoke tests, and deploy to target environments (staging, canary, production) with rollback strategies; 2) Infrastructure-as-Code templates (Terraform/CloudFormation) or manifests (Kubernetes Helm/Manifests) for all required environments and resources (compute, caches, message brokers, load balancers); 3) Environment configuration and secrets management plan (secure vault integration, environment variable conventions, staging/production differences); 4) Security hardening checklist (network policies, TLS enforcement, CSP headers, least-privilege IAM roles, logging and audit retention); 5) Observability setup: logs, structured traces, metrics dashboards, alerting rules for SLO breaches and operational incidents; 6) Runbooks and on-call playbooks for common incidents (auth failures, data pipeline outages, real-time disconnects); 7) User documentation and admin guides covering feature usage, role management, troubleshooting steps, and upgrade notes.
